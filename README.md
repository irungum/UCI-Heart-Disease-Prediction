## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/irungum/UCI_Heart_Disease_Analysis.git
   cd UCI_Heart_Disease_Analysis

Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook UCI_Heart_Disease_Data.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to:

Preprocess the data.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Train multiple machine learning models.
Evaluate model performance and identify the best model.
Example Workflow
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load necessary libraries and datasets.
Handle missing values using iterative imputer.
Split data into features (X) and target variable (Y).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Check distribution of target variable.
Perform data visualization to understand feature and target distribution.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train multiple classification models: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Naive Bayes.
Evaluate models using cross-validation and test set accuracy.
Identify the best performing model based on accuracy.
